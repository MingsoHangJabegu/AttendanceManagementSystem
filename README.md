# attendance

A Flutter project for Attendance Management System made for the completion of my Summer Project.

## Getting Started

- Clone the files and debug the main.dart file.
- No apk file as of yet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple Flutter project for students to take attedance using an Android application. The admins can manage the attendance and users using the simple web application. 

The android application only allows logging in to the application through a certain IP Address which you need to edit from the source code. This was thought to be the easiest solution as the institution can ask for a static public IP Address from the ISP (may incur additional charges). 

The design was given minimum time so please don't judge it too harshly.

(My first every project)
